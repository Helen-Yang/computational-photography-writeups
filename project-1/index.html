  	<h1>CS 194-26 Project 1: Images of the Russian Empire</h1>
  	<h2>General Method</h2>
  		<p>
  			Given the plates of 3 black and white images, taken with either a red, green, or blue filter, the task is to spatially align them so that combining them on top of each other with their respective color channels would produce a color image. 
  			<br><br>
  			To quantify how well 2 images (or shifts of images) were matched, Sum of Squared Differences (SSD, also known as L2 norm) was calculated over the pixel values: 
	  		<tt>SSD(img1, img2) = sum((p1-p2)<sup>2</sup>)</tt> for corresponding pixels <tt>p1</tt> and <tt>p2</tt> in each image.  
	  	</p>
  	<h2>Naive</h2>
	  	<p>
	  		The naive method was iterating through a range of absolute pixel displacements [-15, 15] in each direction and choosing the best shift based on the SSD of each. For the large images, shifts greater than +/- 15 pixels were needed, and searching through 100<sup>2</sup> shifts became impractical. 
	  	</p>
  	<h2>Image Pyramid and Cropping</h2>
	  	<p> 
	  		While the naive solution may work for the compressed .jpg images which have a file size on the order of 100 KB, the .tiff images are on the order of a 100 MB, making searching (and shifting) over many pixels expensive. An image pyramid can be used to optimize the search for closest alignment, reducing the alignment search complexity from n<sup>2</sup> to log(n). 
	  		<br><br>
	  		I used an image pyramid of depth 5, so the alignment search was done with copies of the image at 5 different resolutions, starting with the lowest. Once the best alignment was found at a level, I would go up to the next level and only search the alignments in the area of the best previously found alignment.  
	  		<br><br>
	  		In addition, cropping the solid black and white borders of the image greatly improved the results of the algorithm for most photos. 
	  	</p>

  					<p style="font-size: 70%">Note: emir.tif resulted in problems with the cropped algorithm because the colors of the man's clothes for the R versus B channels were almost inverted, resulting in the SSD measure considering a visually correct alignment to have high error. Therefore, keeping more of the border by not cropping helped keep the alignments more accurate for this image. A technique like edge detection which is more immune to these changes in brightness would probably be better. </p>
